### Empathy Assessment from Eye Fixations
This repository contains code and data for a project that explores the relationship between empathy and eye fixations. The project is based on the idea that eye fixations can provide insight into a person's attentional processes, and that these processes are related to empathy.

Project Overview
The project consists of two main parts:

Data collection: Participants view a series of images while their eye movements are tracked. The images are designed to elicit different levels of empathy, and participants are also asked to rate their empathic responses to each image.

Data analysis: Eye-tracking data is processed to extract relevant features, and these features are then used to predict empathy ratings.

Data
The data used in this project is contained in the data directory. It consists of eye-tracking data, image stimuli, and empathy ratings collected from participants.

Code
The code used in this project is contained in the code directory. It consists of Python scripts for processing eye-tracking data and building predictive models.
